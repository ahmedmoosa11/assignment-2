The History Flashcard App is a native Android application developed in Kotlin using Android Studio, designed to help users test their knowledge of historical facts through a simple true/false quiz format. The app consists of three primary screens: a welcome screen with a start button, a flashcard screen that displays five questions one by one using a loop with true/false answer buttons and feedback for each response, and a score screen that shows the total correct answers along with personalized feedback and options to review answers or exit the app. Two parallel arrays store the questions and their corresponding answers, and a score counter tracks the userâ€™s performance throughout the quiz. The app uses GitHub for version control, with regular commits and a public repository, and integrates GitHub Actions to automate build testing, ensuring the app compiles and runs across different systems. Manual testing confirmed the accuracy of navigation, answer validation, score tracking, and feedback mechanisms, while GitHub Actions provided continuous integration support. The app prioritizes simplicity and usability, adhering to material UI standards, with clear code documentation and logging used for debugging. Overall, the project demonstrates core skills in mobile development, user interface design, and DevOps, delivering a functional and educational flashcard app that meets all assignment requirements.
